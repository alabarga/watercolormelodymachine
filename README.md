## Install

This project uses typescript for the code management of tensoflow.js and we manage the transpilation with webpack

Install

`yarn install`

For development we use webpack-dev-server

`yarn start`

And we prepare the project to publish

`yarn build`

## Disclaimer

The code is developed in prototype mode, trying to be more decisive in the problems we were trying to solve, than elegant. If you want to give it a spin and order the excess of coupling, the welcome will be your contributions.
Neither have we worked on the optimization prioritizing the publication.

The sketch has even the inheritance of typescript is not necessary, but it is an initial experiment, which I am sorry to delete :)
